rational-number
===============

RationalNumber is an implementation for rational numbers in JavaScript
that manages fractions consisting of two integers.  Mathematical
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
are provided.  Division by zero is allowed and should produce correct
mathematical results according to the use of Infinity and NaN in
JavaScript.

Fractions are maintained by default in reduced form.  For example,
setting the value to 2/4 will automatically be reduced (simplified)
to 1/2; However, functions for forcing non-reduced fractions are
provided, particularly to avoid speed issues for intermediate
calculations (although the current mathematical functions will reduce
the fraction after every calculation to minimize the chance of overflow).

This implementation limits the numerator and denominator to the
range from 0 to 2^53&ndash;1 plus a sign.  Optional overflow
detection is included, with the methods checkOverflowOn()
and CheckOverflowOff() turning this feature on and off.


## Using in node applications

This code can be installed for use in [node](http://nodejs.org) by 
installing globally with the command:

``` bash
$ npm install -g rational-number
```

If you want to install locally in a node project, then install as a package
dependency with the command:

``` bash
$ npm install --save rational-number
```

Here is an example of loading the module into a node script and adding two
rational numbers together:

``` javascript
var RationalNumber = require('rational-number');
    
var rn1 = new RationalNumber(4, 5);
var rn2 = new RationalNumber('26/4');
var rn3 = rn1.add(rn2);
console.log(rn1.toString(),"+",rn2.toString(),"=",rn3.toString());
console.log(rn1.toStringMixed("_"),"+",rn2.toStringMixed("_"),
   "=",rn3.toStringMixed("_"));
console.log(rn1.valueOf()+" + "+rn2.valueOf()+" = "+rn3.valueOf());
```

The above code should output the following text to the console:

``` text
4/5 + 13/2 = 73/10
4/5 + 6_1/2 = 7_3/10
0.8 + 6.5 = 7.3
```


## Using in web browsers

The JavaScript files for RationalNumber can also be used within
a webpage by including these two files:

``` HTML
<script src="RationalNumber-base.js"></script>
<script src="RationalNumber-math.js"></script>
```

The first file (RationalNumber-base.js) is required, while the
second one containing mathematical functions (add, subtract, etc.)
is optional.  The lib directory contains a makefile with example
commands to generate minified versions of the programs files.

to try an online demo of rational number calculations running within
a webpage.


## Testing

Input and output from the code can be tested using
[mocha](http://mochajs.org) and the JavaScript files in the `test`
directory.  To test from a node installation:

``` bash
$ npm install   # to download mocha dependency if necessary
$ npm test
```
